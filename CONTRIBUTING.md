## Guidelines

To ensure consistency and accuracy, please follow these guidelines when contributing to the Extension Name JSON:

- Double-check the extension and its full name before adding or modifying them.

- Use lowercase for the extension and enclose it in double quotes (e.g., `".csv"`).

- Use proper title case for the full name (e.g., "Comma-Separated Values").

- Avoid duplicate entries. If you're modifying an existing extension, make sure to update the existing entry rather than creating a new one.

- If you're unsure about an extension or its full name, please do some research and verify the information before adding it to the JSON file.

## Example

```json
{
    ".txt": "Text Document"
}
```
